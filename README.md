**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**  

Bring up any issues in the group slack or talk to someone one-on-one if needed. Open lines of cummunication. Everyone is learning and be understanding of that. If anyone is having issues solving things alone we can use partner programming or sharing screens to figure it out together.

Let them know to delegate tasks more and that they're taking over a bit too much. It's a team effort.

Offer to help or change the way were programming together. Don't call them out in the group setting, just offer to help out if you notice something or talk it over with the person.

This game is for entertainment purposes so when you have freetime you can relax and tend to crops. Some socialization between other players.

Present a game where you are able to view (through plain text) the state of crops and view other people's farm.
